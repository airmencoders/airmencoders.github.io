## Applications are now closed
The June 7 cohort had a 4% acceptance rate due to a limited number of slots and hundreds of applications. This meant that many qualified applicants were not admitted. Your notification email specifies one of the following categories:

* Selected – congratulations you are one of a few select Airmen we were able to admit.
* Qualified, not selected – this means we really wanted to admit you but simply didn’t have enough seats
* Not qualified – this means your application was either not complete, your Commander did not release you, or you scored below our minimum threshold on the pre-assessment. We encourage you to continue doing the pre-work and check out them many self paced courses at digitalu.af.mil.

We hope to offer more courses in the future but do not currently have any funded cohorts. If your organization wishes to fund SDI seats please reach out and we will put you in contact with the vendor.

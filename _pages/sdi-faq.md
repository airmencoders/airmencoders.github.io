## Welcome
This course is an intensive 12-week software development program that will prepare you with critical skills in software engineering. Software touches everything in the military, and this program will teach you the skills needed to master software engineering and build real working programs. We are looking for servicemembers who enjoy problem-solving and want to take their technical skills to the next level. Although no previous experience is required, our entrance assessment will require some basic programming skills.

## Welcome
This course is an intensive 12-week software development program that will prepare you with critical skills in software engineering. Software touches everything in the military, and this program will teach you the skills needed to master software engineering and build real working programs. We are looking for servicemembers who enjoy problem-solving and want to take their technical skills to the next level. Although no previous experience is required, our entrance assessment will require some basic programming skills.

We strongly recommend you go through the available prep work that will prepare you with basic programming skills needed to pass our assessment and be accepted to the program. Alternatively, if you are already proficient in Javascript, you are welcome to take the assessment without doing prep work.

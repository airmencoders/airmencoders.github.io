## Background
Members of the cyberspace support community participated in a career field manager-led working group to establish a digital badging construct for the 3DXXX community. This project is part of a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between HQ AETC/A3BA and Credly, Inc.

The goal of the CRADA is to develop a Department of the Air Force digital credentialing framework that recognizes Airmen’s knowledge, skills, abilities, and experiences through an easily-accessible, verified, and validated digital portfolio, which will ultimately enhance response capabilities for emerging mission requirements. The CRADA will extend through the calendar year; however, any individual who earns a badge will retain the credential indefinitely.

Our vision is that digital badges will serve in lieu of legacy training systems (TBA, AFTR, 623s) by providing a more comprehensive representation of the knowledge, skills, and abilities our members gain through military service; additionally, as members transition from military service, digital credentials will follow them to non-military (industry, academic, civilian, etc.) sectors.

Digital badges are unlike traditional learning histories and archive systems because they provide consumers with access to underlying metadata (i.e., digital portfolio of programs, training, and developmental experiences). Each badge recognizes a unique skill set and provides an opportunity for the cyberspace support community to showcase their abilities. This is a new method to recognize talent and track development.


## Earning Process
As part of the badge-earning process, individuals will compile evidence that substantiates their achievements, which will require a higher-level validation review. For the Cyberspace Support community, the Earner’s supervisor will act as the badge review authority. Each badge has a linked rubric/checklist for evidence review and recommendation for award of the badge.

After the Earner reviews the badge criteria, completes the requisite tasks, compiles a portfolio of evidence, and has the evidence reviewed according to the badge rubric, the earner will need to submit the entire portfolio with signed rubric review to either:

## Digital Badging Pathway

 The above digital badging pathway is a recommendation for the order in which Earners should achieve badges. The badges progress in difficulty from the basic Bronze level, to the intermediate Silver and then the advanced Gold level (NMI has an additional Platinum level master badge). While each AFSC has their own targeted badges, there are general tracks for Quality Assurance and Project Management for any AFSC. Even though these badges are focused on the 3D0X4 and 3D1X2 AFSCs, anyone that meets the earning criteria may earn the badge(s).
